The final submission will be checked for originality through Turnitin when you submit. Penalties may apply for late submission as indicated in the course outline. 
Background 
An important aspect of human-centered design is actual human verification. As designers, we would have preconceived notions of what is appropriate. After all, we have built up a knowledge base in this field and know what we’redoing, right? However, in spite of our best efforts, our fellow humans will very often negate our assumptions by doing unexpected things with our designs. This is an on-going challenge in human-centered design, as humans are complicated and imperfect creatures. As good designers, we must meet this challenge.
Assessment Description 
You are to take the prototype completed in Assessment 1 and refine it using a user-centric, iterative design process. This will involve gathering user feedback on the prototype and then iteratively modifying the prototype based on the feedback. Once you have gone through a few iterations or are satisfied with the quality of your prototype, demonstrate代 写DDES9902 | Human Dimensions in Immersive Environments Assessment Task 2: Human-centred Design ProcessPython

You must also include a report documenting your iterative design process. Justify your feedback gathering methodology and iteration modifications using human-centric design principles. 
You are reminded that a prototype is something that you can give to a user to be able to independently evaluate and operate. This is distinct to a sketch or a wireframe. or a concept document. 
Using your Assessment 1 project as a starting point is recommended to reduce your workload. However, if you feel you would really like to start a new project, you are not restricted from doing so. Please consult with your instructor before heading down this path. It is a higher workload than required, and not recommended. 
Submission Requirements 
1.   A short design and iteration process report.
a.    500 words min, 1000 words max
b.    PDF document
c.    Content over 1000 word limit may be placed in an Appendix section to give further context. However, this will not be the primary consideration for your grade. Put the content you want to be graded within the 1000 word limit 
2.   Live run-through recoding of a prototype.
a.    MP4 or AVI format 
b.    4 minutes max 
c.    Less than 200MB
i.   If you are having difficulty staying below the file size limit, please upload the video to The University’s OneDrive system. Do not use 3rd party cloud service as The University has a  requirement of keeping a record of submitted assessment tasks.
